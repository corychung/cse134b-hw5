Since I was pretty satisfied with my site visually, I decided to make more changes for scalability. These involved:

- Turning the header, footer, and theme picker button/dialog into Web Components 
- Adding a button to load my default projects, returning them back onto the projects page
- Cleaning up my CSS file to be more readable
- Reorganizing the folder structure of my site to be easier to maintain, especially the JS
- Added a "back to top" and "return back to projects" button to the individual projects pages
