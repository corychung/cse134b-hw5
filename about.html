                <h2>Who is Cory?</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Cory. Currently a UCSD student pursuing UX design as a career path and minoring in Computer Science. However, outside of career and academia, I love making and creating things and learning more about tech. Hopefully some of my projects can give you a good idea of what I like to do in my free time, from 3D printing to frontend web dev. I'm also interested in AI and the startup world and would love to pursue opportunities related to that. Always looking for something new to make!</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>How long have you been 3D printing?</summary>
                    <p>Since 2017! My parents bought me a 3D printer kit called the "Anet A8" made of acrylic and a lot of loose wires (also famous for fire hazards but luckily not mine). Ever since then, I've worked with various other brands, tinkering and upgrading, and currently use a Bambu A1 mini. </p>

                    <summary>Why choose UI/UX with such a maker background?</summary>
                    <p>I've always been a tinkerer but for some reason I never thought of my background there as a potential career choice. I like keeping it separate as it gives me the freedom to explore my own fields rather than pressure to adhere to some job criteria. Plus when it comes to UI/UX I like solving problems, so working towards a set goal makes things much easier.</p>

                    <summary>What software tools do you use?</summary>
                    <p>While it tends to vary as I love trying out new things, here are my current standards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Figma - UI/UX Design</li>
                        <li>Fusion - 3D Modeling</li>
                        <li>Orca Slicer, Bambu Studio - 3D Printer Slicing</li>
                        <li>VS Code - Web Development</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I've also been tinkering with new 2D design programs like Affinity Designer and video editing programs like DaVinci Resolve!</p>
